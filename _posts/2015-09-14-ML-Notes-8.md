## K-Means algorithm

Inputs : 

- K (number of clusters)
- Training set $${x^{(1)}, ... , x^{(m)}}$$

Cost function :

\\[J = \frac{1}{m}\sum\_{i=1}^{m}\|x^{(i)}-\mu_{c^{(i)}}\|^2
\\]

We could repeat the following process for 50 - 1000 times and pick the clustering that gives the lowest cost.

1. Ramdomly initialize K cluster centroids $$\mu_1, ... ,\mu_k $$  
   Randomly pick K training examples  
   Set $$\mu_1, ... ,\mu_k $$ equal to these examples
   
2. Repeat  
  - Cluster assignment step  
    for i=1:m  
	 $$c_i$$ = index of cluster centroid (1~K) closest to $$x_i$$
  - Move centroid  
    for k=1:K  
    $$\mu_k$$ = mean of points assigned to cluster k
